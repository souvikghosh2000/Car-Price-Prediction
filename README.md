# Car Price Prediction


## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the second-hand price of a car based on various parameters, including location, power, transmission, initial cost, year, owner type, engine, and seats. The predictive models utilized in this project include Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forest. Additionally, fine-tuning techniques have been applied to enhance the accuracy of the models.
